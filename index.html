My name is Adarsh and this is my Health blog.</p>
<p>Exercise improves physical health. Physically active
individuals have a much better health outlook than their sedentary
peers. Even modest regular physical activity has a positive influence
on people's health and vitality. A minimum of 20 to 30 minutes of
moderate activity a day most days of the week will benefit health and
assist with weight loss. A formal workout is not necessary to have
these benefits; a brisk walk will suffice (although a more vigorous
workout will suffice that much more).<br>
<br>
Exercise reduces risks for serious illness. Exercise reduces people's
chances of developing and dying of illnesses such as heart disease. It
does this by lowering illness risk factors such as triglyceride and
overall cholesterol levels, while improving the level of HDL (the
"good" cholesterol which is thought to reduce the risk of heart
disease).&nbsp;.<br>
<br>
Exercise increases energy and vitality feelings. Sedentary individuals
often complain of being too tired to work out. Ironically, exercise
improves people's capacity for work so that people who exercise on a
regular basis actually have more energy and greater strength and
endurance for daily activities than do their sedentary peers. The
feeling of increased energy, and vitality is one of the first things
people tend to notice a few weeks after beginning to working out on a
regular basis.<br>
<br>
Exercise improves mood. Exercise helps people to relax, improves sleep
and reduces muscular tension. That glow of relaxation after a workout
is restorative. Research shows that one of the best things a person can
do when depressed is to force themselves to exercise. The mood
elevation effect is immediate.<br>
<br>
Exercise improves self-confidence. One of the reasons many individuals
do not attempt an exercise program is because they feel they are not
very athletic or coordinated. Once an exercise program is begun,
however, these same individuals discover that they are indeed able to
work out successfully: gaining muscle tone and strength, improving
their stamina, and improving how they feel emotionally. These
revelations are very empowering. It is this increased sense of self
confidence and improved sense of well-being that eventually becomes the
sustaining force that helps people to continue their exercise program.<br>
